# Front End Refactoring Challenge


So we have a pretty cool idea for a new app.  It can keep track of things that you need to do.
We're going to call it a "to-do" app.  It's pretty ground breaking stuff.

The app works fine and does what we want it to do. Sure the styling is off, but
you should not worry about that for now.  We are just concerned about the JavaScript and React code.

One of the previous developers from forever ago said that he knew how to code a
React app like a pro.  But looking over what he coded, we aren't so sure
he did things correctly.  Can you take a look over the codebase and refactor
it to how you think a React app should be?

You can do whatever you think is best:
install libraries, add/remove/reorganize files, etc. 
Just use your best judgment to help us in making the code better and easier to maintain.

Notes:
- Clone this repo.  `npm install`, then `npm start` to get your development environment running.

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

- You call the shots on what you think is best on how to improve this project.  But **do not add or remove any features**.

- Again, **don't worry about styling or CSS**. Just focus on JavaScript and React.

- Feel free to add notes your cloned repo to explain your thought process.
